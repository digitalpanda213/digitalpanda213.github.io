            <h2>How It's Made: This Blog</h2>
            <p>This website is really my first venture into web developement. I remember when I was younger I briefly studied HTML and made website or two off of a tutorial, but that was years ago and tutorials only teach so much. But of course, this website too started with a tutorial. They many not always teach much, but I had to start somewhere and CodeAcademy certainly helped. I went through their tutorial about publishing a website, and once I was finished I copy & pasted it my own files and hosted it on github. I had intentions of simply modifying those files, but i realized that I wasn't really understand the connection between HTML&CSS because bootstrap was doing so much for me. I decided that I should be able to make a website from scratch as a CS student so I scrapped everything and started reading online about HTML&CSS. After a week or so of trying to learn more about it in my scant amount of free time, I decided to jump in head first.</p>
            <h3>divs, ems, px, vh, vw</h3>
            <p>One would think something so simple as a font size would be simple, but no. From the start I really wanted my website to be atleast somewhat responsive, and this has lead to some issues still not yet fixed on the main page. Largely from overusing vh, vw, and calc. The main header had the issue that while using px when the screen would shrink, the text would clip and overlay on itself. So after a bit of googling, I found out about vh, vw, and calc. Well I just started slapping them on everything. In the process of editing the majority of it out.</p>
