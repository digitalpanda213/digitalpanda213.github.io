                	<p>Well hello there, I see you've stumbled across my blog. I suspect you either know me personally, saw my resume, or have delved far to deep into the interwebs and are very lost. Well, this website is directed towards the former two as you might expect. I started this blog for a few reasons, <b>1.</b> To show prospective employers what I'm learning and working on. <b>2.</b> To learn HTML & CSS and to have a website to host C# web project. And finally <b>3.</b> for the personal reason, to give others a way to better understand me. Hopefully over the coming months I can fulfill those objectives.</p>
