                	<p>Lately I've been studying kanji quite a lot and I've really been wanting a tool to decompose knaji into thier component, but it turns out a tool like this doesn't exist. I recently went to HackNC, a hackathon at UNC, and I started working on just such a program. Sadly I ran into some major snags along the way. If it was going to be easy, it would have already been done. I'll be keeping track of my progress here.</p>

                	<p>I'm the kind of person who kept my favorite color a secret for the majority of my childhood. As a kid I enjoyed the challenge of keeping secreting. Now I find the real challenge to be revealing myself. That's what this post is for. I typically don't like to talk about myself unless I think doing so would be of benefit, but that preference has led to something never being said that probably should have been. I'll start off with a generally introduction, and then delve deeper.</p>

			    	<h3>Title: Beginning of the Blog.</h3>
                	<p>Well hello there, I see you've stumbled across my blog. I suspect you either know me personally, saw my resume, or have delved far to deep into the interwebs and are very lost. Well, this website is directed towards the former two as you might expect. I started this blog for a few reasons, <b>1.</b> To show prospective employers what I'm learning and working on. <b>2.</b> To learn HTML & CSS and to have a website to host C# web project. And finally <b>3.</b> for the personal reason, to give others a way to better understand me. Hopefully over the coming months I can fulfill those objectives.</p>
