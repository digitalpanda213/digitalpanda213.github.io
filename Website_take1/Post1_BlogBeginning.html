            <h2>Title: Beginning of the Blog</h2>
            <p>To be entirely frank, if someone other than myself ever reads this i'll be quite suprised. Well, unless perhaps they're reading it over my shoulder in the library. BUT MORE TO THE POINT! The blog! I'll start from the very beginning with the idea of this blog.</p>
            <h3>"My resume is rubbish!" I said to myself</h3>
            <p>As of writing I'm a Sophomore CS student and near the end of my freshman year  I decided to put together a resume in case I'd happen to need one, and it didn't go too well. I've never formally worked, despite having made dozen of simple games I had never fully polished and finished one, I didn't have 4.0 GPA, I didn't have any honors or achievments, and all-in-all I had nothing to put down to help me stand out. Sure I could pad the resume by put five-stars for my "problem solving skills" but that felt so lame. So I began to think of not-so-lame things I could add to my resume. That summer I more fully than ever developed a Unity game and then published it this semester. After that I decided to make a website from scratch to show-and-tell my game and everything else I might need a website for. Which leads us to how I made this website</p>
            <h3>"Well darn, that's not right..."</h3>
            <p>Going into making this website I had no idea how to make a website. I got the domain name for free for going to my school's hack-a-thon, and git-hub is hosting becuase apperantly they do that. I started with that becuase I atleast knew what a "free domain name @ domain.com" flyer was. I moved on to CodeAcademy's HTML & CSS tutorial where I thought I learned how to use HTML & CSS until I opened up a blank HTML file. So I made the logical choice of copying & pasting the "finished" website from CodeAcademy. I then yet again realized I didn't really understand anything when I noticed BootStrap was doing pretty much everything. So I threw bootstrap away since I more cared about learning the languages rather than a framework. From that point on it really has just been the classic "Well darn, that's not right... let's check the internet." There are still LOADS of issue and mistakes all around the website, but it all takes time. Improvements will come, thing will get less ugly, features will be added, and eventually things will be worth showing.</p>
			<h3>"It's coming together now! wait why am I doing this?"</h3>
			<p>Of course yes one of the primary reasons I'm making this website is for my resume, but hopefully this website will become more than that. I've always been a particulary quiet person and don't often express myslef unless I feel that doing so would bring value to others, but I rarely feel that way. This is confounded by the fact that I live on-campus away from my family. Growing up I never realized the problem with expressing myself so little and keeping the majority of my opinions and feeling to myself, but I eventually came to the point where I began to feel like part of myself was hidden from others. I came to realize that so many of my relationships felt so shallow stemmed from the fact that never reveal anything of depth about myself. I don't mean to make this sound like the ranting of a teenage edge-lord, but I think this is an issue in my life and I believe in always trying to improve. Perhaps I'm all wrong, but all one can do is try.</p>
			<h3>"Oh yeah, they probably care about the code"</h3>
			<p>I'm currently swamped with coding project. Generating a voxel world in Unity using C#, learning C++ and openGL, this website, and learning about making C# web services. I hope to write about my progress though these projects the obstacles I encounter and how I solve them hopefully this will who my problem solving skills beter than than just throwing a 5-Stars by it on a resume. I'll let these ppost speak for themselves as they come out. じゃあね！</p>
