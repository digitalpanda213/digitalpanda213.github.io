            <h2>About Me: An Overview</h2>
            <p>As of writing this I am a 19 year old Computer Science Major at Appalachian State. I live in Charolette when school is out, but I grew up in Florida, Wellington, until I was 16. My hobbies include Game Development, Japanese, Drawing, Rock Climbing, and mandolin. I'm super friendly and overall a happy, nice dude, but I'm also pretty shy so you might have to say hi first. I'm relitively traditional in my beliefs. God and family very much come first for me. I love to debate small things like broccoli Vs. calliflower. If you want to see me passionate ask me about cereal. My father is a stock broker, mother is housewife, and I have 2 sisters and 1 brother. My older sister also has 2 kids and is married. I've been coding since i was about 11 or so, studying japanese since January of 2015, and drawing since forever ago. My biggest goal in life is to have kids and raise them well. That being said I've never been in a retionship. </p>
